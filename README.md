Maya Ives is a site Created by Alexandra Cojocea. The branding of the website was created by Paulius Bulovas.

Maya Ives is a personal website created to provide a means of contact and self-expression. Also, it is supposed to advertise the garmits produced by Maya. Although the site was created for a fictional person and has no back-end functionality, the website was an opportunity to utilize SCSS and practice creating responsive webites with added JavaScript animation.

Built With standard HTML5, SCSS and jQuery. Flexslider was used for the main slider.

Check out the FashionSite.mp4 for a short demonstration of the website.
